Two years ago, I just wanted a cleaner, more convenient two-factor authentication tool. Back then, my phone was filled with various authenticator apps—they worked, but none fit my workflow perfectly. So, I started writing the first lines of code and created the first version of **CloudOTP**.

The initial version was built using native Android. The interface was simple, and the features were minimal: scan QR codes, generate codes, copy codes. It was almost only for my personal use, yet it gave me my first real sense that a tool could truly serve “my way.”

Later, I discovered **Flutter**. A new idea emerged: why not make CloudOTP easily usable on desktop as well? I began a full refactor—from architecture to UI, from logic to animations. I spent countless hours adjusting layouts, scaling icons, fine-tuning fonts. Step by step, the desktop version became more modern, smooth, and natural to use.

The desktop refactor went through multiple stages. From 1.x to 3.x, the UI evolved countless times: from classic card layouts to responsive grids, from shadow-heavy buttons to flat designs, from fixed windows to adaptive layouts. These seemingly minor adjustments transformed CloudOTP from “usable” to “pleasant to use.”

Functionality also expanded. CloudOTP now supports multiple cloud backup options, letting users choose trusted services to sync their data, and it can import credentials from various other apps. Security and convenience no longer have to be mutually exclusive.

Today, CloudOTP has surpassed **180 GitHub stars** over two years and has been recommended by many developer friends and colleagues. Feedback like “I use this tool on my work computer every day” or “This is much cleaner than other authenticators” keeps me motivated and confirms the original vision.

Development never stops. **Version 3.x** is a milestone, but I continue refining the desktop experience, improving interaction, and exploring more cloud sync options and plugin extensions. CloudOTP is more than an app—it is two years of persistence and growth, the journey of an indie developer.

**Feel Safe, Stay Swift.**
