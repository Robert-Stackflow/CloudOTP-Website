## Upgrade Overview

* Feature: Support for Google Drive, Aliyun Drive, Box, and Huawei Cloud.
* Optimization: Improve UI performance on PC and tablet devices.
* Optimization: Remove sensitive permissions on Android (installing apps, selecting images).
* Fix: Issue where changing language, theme, light/dark mode, or font did not update certain pages in time.
* Fix: Issue where enabling background lock caused abnormal locking during screenshot recognition or OAuth authentication via browser.
  Due to limitations of services such as Google Drive, Box, Huawei Cloud, and Aliyun Drive, the OAuth authorization process needs to be proxied through the server [https://api.cloudchewie.com](https://api.cloudchewie.com) to ensure proper functionality. This server is built with Node.js, and the related code is open source and hosted on GitHub at [CloudOTP-OAuth](https://github.com/Robert-Stackflow/CloudOTP-OAuth).
