description: How to resolve the "SQLCipher library is missing" prompt in CloudOTP application.
---

When your CloudOTP application prompts "SQLCipher library is missing", it means that your CloudOTP application cannot decrypt the database normally because CloudOTP relies on the SQLCipher library to encrypt and decrypt the SQLite database.

## Solution

Please follow these steps to resolve this issue:

- Click [here](https://pkgs.cloudchewie.com/CloudOTP/sqlite_sqlcipher.dll) to download the `sqlite_sqlcipher.dll` file.

- Move the `sqlite_sqlcipher.dll` file to the installation directory of the CloudOTP application

<Callout type="info">
Normally, the installation directory defaults to `C:\Program Files\CloudOTP`. If you change the installation directory during installation, please move the file to the directory you specified.
</Callout>

- Restart the CloudOTP application.
